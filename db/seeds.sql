The story did a great job showing the struggles of a deaf family. The lead character also signs and sings. Her family is deaf but their support is tangible.'),
('The movie was great was funny and exciting to watch would definitely watch the movie again'),
('The main character’s acting was overly dramatic. I honestly thought the first 20% of the movie was decent and then why lost me when it started getting political. I kept watching but wish I had not. I still don’t fully understand the premise.'),
('It was absolutely amazing! Felt like I was watching the continuation of the Civil War and before Infinity War! I was really impressed how the story seemed to flow with the other Marvel Movies!'),
('This was absolutely nail-biting! No gore, all suspense. The usual protagonist poor judgement actually makes sense here. :)');
